# build-flask-REST-API

ðŸŒŸ Created by Mohamed Idrish as part of his journey to master Flask and RESTful APIs, building confidence in real-time backend development for future software projects.

ðŸš€ This program uses Postman to send and test different types of HTTP requests (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) to understand how data flows between a client and a server practically.

ðŸŽ¯ Designed to strengthen my understanding of CRUD operations, JSON data handling, and API testing skills â€“ essential for becoming a strong Python backend developer in my upcoming projects.
